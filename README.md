## Getting Started

You can test the app in its deployed version here https://find-open.vercel.app/, (better if you test it on a cellphone as it needs geolocation to work properly) or if you wanna run it locally you can clone the repo and run `npm install` to make sure all dependencies are in order.

NOTE: Keep in mind that if you run the project locally, you'll need to use your own API key to make use of the google maps API.

Then, run the development server which will probably use Port 3000:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

-- The App is in Spanish, so the further explanations will be in Spanish. If you'd like me to make it in English as well, let me know and I'll see if I can make it happen :)
